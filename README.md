Percolation Theory is a problem under the Graph Theory researches. <br /> 
In statistical physics and mathematics, percolation theory describes the behavior of a network when nodes or links are removed.

In this project we have a NxN grid initialized with open sites(white blocks), closed sites(black blocks), and one random open site with water in it(coloured blue).
